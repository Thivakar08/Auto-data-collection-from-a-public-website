Web Scraper for News Headlines:

Objective:

This script scrapes the top news headlines from a public news website using Python. 
It automates the process of collecting current headlines and saves them into a text file.

Tools Used:

 requests: To fetch the HTML content of the webpage.
 BeautifulSoup (from bs4): To parse and extract specific elements (e.g., <h1>, <h2>, <h3> tags) from the HTML.

Steps Performed:

1. The script sends a GET request to the BBC News homepage.
2. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the returned HTML content.
3. It searches for all <h1>, <h2>, and <h3> tags that typically contain headlines.
4. It extracts the text from these tags, avoids duplicates, and stores them in a list.
5. Finally, it writes all the collected headlines to a file called 'headlines.txt'.
